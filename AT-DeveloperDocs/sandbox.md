## Sandbox :muscle:

This is basically the **test** environment.  For a more elaborate explanation:


```
A sandbox is a controlled environment that allows testing and experimentation, often used in software development to ensure the safety of changes before implementation in a production environment.
```

 All tests run here do NOT reflect on a real phone, they reflect on the [Africa's Talking Simulator](https://developers.africastalking.com/simulator).

The Sandbox App Dashboard is similar to the Live App Dashboard explained [here](/AT-AccountSetup/) as shown in the following image:

The following are the main differences between __*Live*__ and __*Sandbox*__:

| **Sandbox** | **Live** |
---
| **Orange** colour used in the UI | **Green** colour used in the UI |
| Username is **sandbox** | Username is **the unique username you set when creatinhg the app** |
| Account balance is **N/A** | Account balance is **the value of your account's balance** |
